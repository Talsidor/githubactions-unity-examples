# Getting Started

This repo contains 3 example build scripts for using GitHub Actions and self-hosted runners to make Unity builds:

1. `simple.yml` - Just 4 steps to make and deploy a Unity build.
2. `multiple_platforms.yml` - Demonstrates one way to extend your build pipeline to include Windows, Mac and Linux builds.
3. `discord_notify.yml` - Demonstrates one way you can add notifications to your build pipeline, using a Discord webhook.

Make sure to start with `simple.yml`, it's both the simplest and the most comprehensively documented.
